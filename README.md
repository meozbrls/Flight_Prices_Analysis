## ⏱️ Time Series Forecasting (SARIMA)

To model future ticket prices, a **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)** model was applied.

**Target Route Example:** `LAX-BOS`

### Model Highlights
- Daily median price time series
- Seasonal patterns handled via SARIMA
- Train / test split on time axis
- Forecast horizon: future daily prices

### Evaluation Metrics
- **MAE:** 18.36
- **RMSE:** 24.35
- **MAPE:** 5.95%

The model demonstrates strong performance in capturing seasonal trends and short-term price movements.
